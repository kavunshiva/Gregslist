    {title:"Pre 1800 antiques",
      description: "I am looking for old Mormon artifacts from the book of Mormon. I would like to purchase items from the days of the Nephites and Lamanites such as shields, arrows, bows, knives, or any of the other items that they might have used in there battles, anything would be great. I would also love to have maps, pottery, coins, statues, vases, or any artifacts from the large city of Zarahemla or Mulek. If some one had any writing in reformed Egyptian that was apparently used I would like to see it.
It should be easy to find at least one item from a civilization that had millions of people with cities and large army’s. The picture I included was directly off of the LDS website and it clearly shows swords, spears, breastplates, and shields. All that takes a developed people to make.

Also if any LDS people are out there that were dark skinned and are now changed to “white and delightsome” it would be neat to here your story. I would pay top dollar to any native American that could prove his DNA was from a Jewish background. In 1857, Brigham Young declared that apostates would “become gray-haired, wrinkled, and black, just like the Devil” (Journal of Discourse 5:332). Any apostates out there that this has happened to!! I would give $10,000 for an interview.

I am not interested in any biblical historical items, as they are not that hard to find, I am only interested in Mormon (pre 1800's) items.",

    {title: "Mobile brothel",
      description: "197? Chrysler motor home. I bought this former mobile brothel from one of the oldest pimps in Nevada. I believe it’s the one I was conceived and born in. My mother found it for me a few years ago while volunteering for the humane society in Vegas. I bought it right away for $10,000 because it’s kind of sentimental to us since my father was an aeronautical engineer turned Navy Seal firefighter and a CIA spy who worked for Richard Nixon himself. Needless to say didn’t have much time for dating so he would visit my mom on his rare time off from work in this mobile brothel that she worked in while she saved up money for college. Anyways my mom and I hoped to restore it to it’s former glory days and get her and it back on the road. But after applying for permits, we were denied for a massive crab infestation and mold issues. It starts and runs well. Steers straight and is good in gas. I’d like to get around $10k for it as is. Clean title in hand. Thanks.
P.S. Dad if you are reading this please email me as i would love to meet you someday.",

      description: "In spring cleaning, I was cleaning out a back cabinet and found a glorious starter potato. I feel sad just chucking him since he has made such an impression in attempt at life and propagation. If you have a yard, or garden, and would be willing to take this glorious plant from my hands, I'd be happy, knowing he is able to live his dreams.

I've included photos, to show his gnarly awesomeness, and I hope you can help provide him a great loving home aka fertile soil to grow.",
